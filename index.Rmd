Welcome to **GIF1's** **Introduction to GIS**. This resource focuses on the themes of **data collection**, **fieldwork** and **GIS** for story mapping and digital human geography. Here, we will provide you with the necessary information and training to prepare you for collecting you data needed to accomplish the tasks for the **Urban Project** and workshop 2's **Introduction to GIS**. 

## Structure {-}

This resource is split into **two** parts:

- **Part 1** of this resource contains the necessary self-guided training materials (i.e., guidance notes and demonstration videos) for using the smartphone applications such as **Google Earth APP** and **Strava** for collecting the your data in the field in London and Barcelona.
- **Part 2** contains the information needed to developing your own **Story Maps** using an online platform called **ArcGIS Online**. You will need the data collected from the activities in London and Barcelona field trips to complete the exercise and benefit from the Workshop which will be hosted on **Wednesday 23rd November**, and **Friday 25th November**. The learning content for **Part 2** will be released a week ahead of these dates.
