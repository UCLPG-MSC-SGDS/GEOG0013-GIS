Welcome to **GIF1's** **Introduction to GIS**. This resource focuses on the themes of **data collection**, **fieldwork** and **GIS** for story mapping and digital human geography. Here, we will provide you with the necessary information and training to prepare you for collecting the field data needed to accomplish the assessment for the **Urban Project** and **Introduction to GIS**. 

## Structure {-}

This resource is split into **two** parts:

- **Part 1** of this resource contains the necessary self-guided training materials such as **guidance notes** and **demonstrative videos** for using the smartphone applications such as **Google Earth APP** and **Strava** for collecting your geotagged data in London & Barcelona.
- **Part 2** contains the information needed to developing your own **Story Maps** using the online platform called **ArcGIS Online**. You will need the data collected from the activities in London & Barcelona to complete the assignment. The GIS workshops will be on **Wednesday 13th November**, and **Friday 15th November**. The learning content for **Part 2** will be released a week ahead of these dates.
