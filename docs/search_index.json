This resource focuses on the themes of data collection, fieldwork and GIS for story mapping and digital human geography. Here, we will provide you with the necessary information and training to prepare you for collecting you data needed to accomplish the tasks for the Urban Project and workshop 2’s Introduction to GIS. Structure This resource is split into two parts: Part 1 of this resource contains the necessary self-guided training materials (i.e., guidance notes and demonstration videos) for using the smartphone applications such as Google Earth APP and Strava for collecting the your data in the field in London and Barcelona. Part 2 contains the information needed to developing your own Story Maps using an online platform called ArcGIS Online. You will need the data collected from the activities in London and Barcelona field trips to complete the exercise and benefit from the Workshop which will be hosted on Wednesday 23rd November, and Friday 25th November. The learning content for Part 2 will be released a week ahead of these dates. Contact Details Feel free to contact me via email for help, you can also book appointments for additional support if need be.

For the Barcelona (and London) Urban Project, you will need to bring your worksheet, field notebook (i.e., diary) and smartphone. Note that the section here contains some guidance notes for fulfilling some of the objectives relating to the plotting of routes and recording of geo-tags with smartphones. Here are some following points to do before departing: Install Strava onto at least one group member’s smartphone – this is for route data collection. Install Google Earth onto at least one group member’s smartphone - this is for recording coordinates for the point observations you want to record in accordance to the selected theme (e.g. street vendor locations, graffiti, Catalan flags, cyclists, and other locations that pique your interest). Try the apps out for yourself for familiarity. IMPORTANT NOTE: You will need the two apps to collect your human geography digital data in Barcelona and London. Please make note that the collection of data is a team effort. The more people in the group who install these apps, as well as being engaged with data collection, the better, and the less chance there is of something going wrong in the field. Training materials for Google Earth &amp; Strava app The table below contains all the information needed to get you started with using the smartphone apps. Guidance Google Earth App Strava App [1] How to install apps on smartphone Notes, Video Notes, Video [2] How to collect point or route data Notes, Video Notes, Video TIP: When geo-tagging points of interest, and taking associated notes in diaries, pictures, videos, or audio footage. There has to be a link between the points and collected dataset so you know what information corresponds to each other. We recommend that you apply some reference number for the location with coordinates you geo-tagged (e.g., “site 1” or “S1” and the next will be “site 2” or “S2” etc.,) and then annotate you notes, pictures, videos or audio footage with the same reference number so you know which data corresponds with each other. You can do this with you phones through screenshooting and applying text to it. Here is a crude example (see image below): Revisiting the location in London where the 1854 Cholera epidemic was pronounced What to do next with the collected data? [1] Downloading your route data Once you have finished using Strava, and saving the routes. Downloading your route data from Strava is simple. Here are the steps: Go to https://www.strava.com and log into your user account (i.e., the one you created earlier on when you installed the app) You will log in and see your dashboard. Select your route shown in the home feed. You should be able to download you route data by clicking on the “GPX” highlighted in the image below. We will use this data for the workshop. [2] Compiling you geo-tagged data into a spreadsheet You should compile your geo-tagged data into a spreadsheet and save it as comma separated value format (.csv). You are highly encouraged you collaborate to do this chore as a group: Here are the steps: Create a new spreadsheet in Excel. Create three columns marked `siteID’, ‘latitude’ and ‘longitude’. Input details of the points of interest you recorded in Barcelona into the spreadsheet. To do this you will need to look at your field diary and also any screenshots you took. Make sure that the lat/long coordinates for each site are accurately recorded. Any qualitative information about each site you recorded (e.g. its type, other observations) can also be recorded in a fourth column if you want. Your dataset should end up looking like the screenshot below. Remember that we expect each group to have at least 30 site observations. Save your work as a .csv file. WARNING: When recording your coordinates to a spreadsheet, be mindful of whether a latitude is north (N) or south (S), or a longitude is east (E) or (W). The latitudes for London and Barcelona all fall above the equator (N) and so they should always be a positive value. However, London and Barcelona are very close to the Prime Meridian, and so their longitudes can potentially fall either above (E) or below (W) the Prime Meridian. If the longitude is below the Prime Meridian (W) then add a minus sign to that value. IMPORTANT NOTE: You can compile the data in the comfort of your hotel or when you are back in London. Just make you don’t lose all your hard work! [3] Uploading your shared data to Moodle On the course Moodle page, a forum will be opened for members of each group to upload: The Strava route data (as a .gpx file) The .csv file containing all site observations and their coordinates. Uploading this data to Moodle will ensure everyone from the group can get access to it during and after the practical class. When posting to Moodle, please give your file names informative titles that close team members can recognise the files (for instance Group1_route.gpx etc.). Please this no later than 11:59pm on Tuesday, November 21st 2022 on the week we are having our GIS Workshop. Remember that if the two files are not uploaded to Moodle before the practical class it will not be possible for everyone in the group to complete their work. Videos, notes and photos should be shared among team members via Whatsapp groups.

This session focuses on the themes of GIS (Geographical Information Systems) and Digital Geography. Here, we will provide you with an introduction on how to visualise geographic data collected from the field trip in Barcelona and London using the online platforms: ArcGIS Map, and ArcGIS StoryMaps for interactive mapping and digital storytelling. We prepared some tutorials to help you create you own interactive StoryMap (based on your data collected from abroad) but we will be using the steps from a motivating example used to create the story map titled: “Short Revisit to the Cholera Outbreak in Soho, London (1854)” [SEE EXAMPLE HERE] Timetable &amp; Group Allocation This is a 3-hour group computer practical workshop that will be delivered in-person. All students have been allocated to one of 8 groups (i.e., group A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H or I).

You are welcome to go through the self-guided tutorials presented on this website at your own pace before the workshop. The teaching materials have been designed to be accessible to anyone who has never used the online platforms: ArcGIS Maps or ArcGIS Storymaps. The tutorials are very prescriptive with instructions, and these instructions are supported with guided videos. The workshop is split into two main sections: Creating an interactive map atlas using the ArcGIS Map application Creating a StoryMap in ArcGIS StoryMap application The whole point these tutorials are to provide you guidance on how you can make you own interactive maps and storymap application with you own data collected from Barcelona, or London. IMPORTANT NOTE: You must create an altas and StoryMap, which must be submitted as a link and series of screenshots stitched to your diary. It worth 5.0% of the assessment. Questions &amp; Discusson Forum on Moodle On Moodle you can use the Forum: Questions and Discussion platform to post general questions about the content on this webpage, or for posting problems on technical issues you have encountered during your self-guided study.

Before we do so… here are the steps for getting the appropriate set-up. Please do this set-up so as to make navigation through ArcGIS Map Viewer a lot easier and less painful: Head to your profile settings - you should see your user name (e.g., ucfxxxx@ucl.ac.uk_UCLondon) at the top right corner - click this section. Click My settings Scroll down to the part titled Primary map viewer Select Map Viewer Classic (avoid selecting Map Viewer at all cost) Now, select Map located at the top menu bar to open a new project. How to import spatial data into your new ArcGIS Map project Here, we are going to start importing all our spatial data sets into ArcGIS Map. We will have to do this one file at a time. Let us import the data sets in the following order: Houses_with_Cholera_deaths.csv Houses_with_no_Cholera_deaths.csv Pump_Locations.csv Routes.gpx Area.zip Video [Tutorials]: How to import spatial data and apply various customisations and symbologies (Length: 29:18 mins) If the video does not play within this section, then try playing it from Microsoft Streams - you should be able to view it there using this LINK Important Notes: Access to Microsoft Steams may require use of your UCL institutional login details Here are the steps for importing data: Click on the +Add icon at the top of the viewer. A drop down menu should appear - select the option Add Layer from File A small window titled Add Layer from File will appear. Click on the button Choose File and navigate to the folder in your computer to select the first file in above list i.e., Houses_with_Cholera_deaths.csv Click the button Upload to upload the selected file. Finally, click on the button IMPORT LAYER to load the layer into the map project. Customisation of symbologies Upon loading the data, it will automatically take the first column (i.e, the house identification number) in the data and plot a proportional dot map which is obviously in incorrect. We want to plot this data as Location with a single symbol - preferably as a red colour to symbolise that these where homes with documented Cholera deaths. We can do the using the following steps: On the left hand side of the panel, scroll to the section that says: Location (Single symbol). Click SELECT It should remove the erroneous proportional dot map. Let us change the colours accordingly to Red. Under Location (Single symbol), click on the button OPTIONS Click on Symbols We can change Shape icons if we wish by selecting the desired Shape Category. However, we can leave this as a circle. Lets change the FILL colour from Black to Red so click on FILL. You will see a colour palette - click on the Red. Consistency we also want the OUTLINE of the circle shape to be RED as well. Lets change the OUTLINE colour to Red. Click on OUTLINE and also select Red in that colour palette. Click OK in the small window to confirm colour selection. Finally, click OK about the bottom, and then click DONE for the final confirmation. Rinse and repeat We can repeat the above steps for importing the point data for Houses_with_no_Cholera_deaths.csv and assign its symbology a Green colour. For the Pump_Locations.csv data, we can change the Shape Category and select one of the markers under the Points of Interest category. We can also apply the label names of the pumps from the Pump_Locations.csv to show using the Create Labels option. Watch the video carefully to see how this is done. When importing line and polygon data for the Routes.gpx and Area.zip, respectively. It is essentially the same steps as the above. You may choose to make the symbology for the routes data a thin line by reducing its width and render its line style as a dashed line. For the area - you can make its colour fill 100% transparent. We only want to see the borders of the Soho area only. Watch the video carefully to see how these customisation are done. How to import and configure pop-ups images for point of interest We are going to take a look at how we can configure images to pop-up at features considered to be points of interest. But first, we will need to import them into a repository called Contents. Let us see how to import image files (.png or .jpeg etc.,) into my Contents in ArcGIS Online. Video [Tutorials]: How to import and configure images to pop-up from interactive map (Length: 41:26 mins) If the video does not play within this section, then try playing it from Microsoft Streams - you should be able to view it there using this LINK Important Notes: Access to Microsoft Steams may require use of your UCL institutional login details Here are the following steps: Click on the button New item A New item window should appear. Let us drag and drop the image Pump - interactive map.jpeg into the Drag and drop your file or choose an option section A window will appear where we can add more information about the photo. Here, we can alter the title by typing Broad Street Pump [image]. Click Next and the image should be uploaded into your list of Contents Now, make sure to click on the Share button. Here, we need to select the Everyone (public) option in order to get a URL link - this is what we need to configure the pop-ups to work. Without this option selected it would not work!. Now, we should see the image stored in our My Contents list. We can repeat the above import steps for the remaining images: Pub - interactive map.jpeg Barbers - interactive map.jpeg Market - interactive map.jpeg Camera icon - interactive map.png Death rate icon - interactive map.png Footprint - interactive map.png Now, let us add the images to our interactive map as a pop-up feature to points of interest. We are going to start with the adding the Broad Street Pump [image]. Here are the following steps: Click on the Web Map template we are currently working on i.e., Demonstration to continue the creation of interactive map. Next, click on the button Open in Map Viewer Classic to open it. Zoom in very close to the pump icon labelled Broad Street Pump. Here, we going add a Camera icon image and link whatever details we’ve described for this point of interest. Next, click on the +ADD button and select the option Add Map Notes An Add Map Notes will appear. Here, click the CREATE button. A list of icons will appear. Select Stickpin and hover the point close to the pump icon labelled Broad Street Pump, and click to add Stickpin point on the map. A Points window will appear. In the Title section, type: Broad Street Pump In the Description section, copy and paste the necessary information (see Word Document titled: Text Script) In a separate tab - go into My Contents and select Broad Street Pump [image]. Copy the URL and paste it in the URL sections in the window mentioned in Point 7. We are going to alter the symbology of the Stickpin with our own image of a Camera icon. Here, click on CHANGE SYMBOL and select Use an image In a separate tab - go into My Contents and select Camera icon [image]. Copy the URL and paste it in the URL sections in the symbology window mentioned in Point 10 and click + sign. Click on the new Camera Icon and set the Symbol Size to your preference and click OK, and click CLOSE. Lastly, click on Edit to close out of the editing mode. If you click on the Camera Icon, a pop-up feature with the image and description of the location will appear. Now, we rinse and repeat for the other locations. Watch the video carefully to see how these customisation are done for the remaining images. Make the final save to complete the interactive map.
