This resource focuses on the themes of data collection, fieldwork and GIS for story mapping and digital human geography. Here, we will provide you with the necessary information and training to prepare you for collecting you data needed to accomplish the tasks for the Urban Project and workshop 2’s Introduction to GIS. Structure This resource is split into two parts: Part 1 of this resource contains the necessary self-guided training materials (i.e., guidance notes and demonstration videos) for using the smartphone applications such as Google Earth APP and Strava for collecting the your data in the field in London and Barcelona. Part 2 contains the information needed to developing your own Story Maps using an online platform called ArcGIS Online. You will need the data collected from the activities in London and Barcelona field trips to complete the exercise and benefit from the Workshop which will be hosted on Wednesday 15th November, and Friday 17th November. The learning content for Part 2 will be released a week ahead of these dates. Contact Details Feel free to contact me via email for help, you can also book appointments for additional support if need be.

For the Barcelona (and London) Urban Project, you will need to bring your worksheet, field notebook (i.e., diary) and smartphone. Note that the section here contains some guidance notes for fulfilling some of the objectives relating to the plotting of routes and recording of geo-tags with smartphones. Here are some following points to do before departing: Install Strava onto at least one group member’s smartphone – this is for route data collection. Install Google Earth onto at least one group member’s smartphone - this is for recording coordinates for the point observations you want to record in accordance to the selected theme (e.g. street vendor locations, graffiti, Catalan flags, cyclists, and other locations that pique your interest). Try the apps out for yourself for familiarity. IMPORTANT NOTE: You will need the two apps to collect your human geography digital data in Barcelona and London. Please make note that the collection of data is a team effort. The more people in the group who install these apps, as well as being engaged with data collection, the better, and the less chance there is of something going wrong in the field. Training materials for Google Earth &amp; Strava app The table below contains all the information needed to get you started with using the smartphone apps. Guidance Google Earth App Strava App [1] How to install apps on smartphone Notes, Video Notes, Video [2] How to collect point or route data Notes, Video Notes, Video TIP: When geo-tagging points of interest, and taking associated notes in diaries, pictures, videos, or audio footage. There has to be a link between the points and collected dataset so you know what information corresponds to each other. We recommend that you apply some reference number for the location with coordinates you geo-tagged (e.g., “site 1” or “S1” and the next will be “site 2” or “S2” etc.,) and then annotate you notes, pictures, videos or audio footage with the same reference number so you know which data corresponds with each other. You can do this with you phones through screenshooting and applying text to it. Here is a crude example (see image below): Revisiting the location in London where the 1854 Cholera epidemic was pronounced What to do next with the collected data? [1] Downloading your route data Once you have finished using Strava, and saving the routes. Downloading your route data from Strava is simple. Here are the steps: Go to https://www.strava.com and log into your user account (i.e., the one you created earlier on when you installed the app) You will log in and see your dashboard. Select your route shown in the home feed. You should be able to download you route data by clicking on the “GPX” highlighted in the image below. We will use this data for the workshop. [2] Compiling you geo-tagged data into a spreadsheet You should compile your geo-tagged data into a spreadsheet and save it as comma separated value format (.csv). You are highly encouraged you collaborate to do this chore as a group: Here are the steps: Create a new spreadsheet in Excel. Create three columns marked `siteID’, ‘latitude’ and ‘longitude’. Input details of the points of interest you recorded in Barcelona into the spreadsheet. To do this you will need to look at your field diary and also any screenshots you took. Make sure that the lat/long coordinates for each site are accurately recorded. Any qualitative information about each site you recorded (e.g. its type, other observations) can also be recorded in a fourth column if you want. Your dataset should end up looking like the screenshot below. Remember that we expect each group to have at least 30 site observations. Save your work as a .csv file. WARNING: When recording your coordinates to a spreadsheet, be mindful of whether a latitude is north (N) or south (S), or a longitude is east (E) or (W). The latitudes for London and Barcelona all fall above the equator (N) and so they should always be a positive value. However, London and Barcelona are very close to the Prime Meridian, and so their longitudes can potentially fall either above (E) or below (W) the Prime Meridian. If the longitude is below the Prime Meridian (W) then add a minus sign to that value. IMPORTANT NOTE: You can compile the data in the comfort of your hotel or when you are back in London. Just make sure you don’t lose all your hard work! [3] Uploading your shared data to Moodle On the course Moodle page, a forum will be opened for members of each group to upload the following: The shared Strava route data (as a .gpx file) The shared .csv file containing all site observations and their coordinates. Uploading this data to Moodle will ensure everyone from the group can get access to it during and after the practical class. When posting to Moodle, please give your file names with informative titles so that close team members can recognize the files (for instance Group1_route.gpx etc.). Please share this no later than 11:59pm on Tuesday, November 14th 2023 on the week we are having our GIS Workshop. Remember that if the two files are not uploaded to Moodle before the practical class it will not be possible for everyone in the group to complete their work. [4] Sharing your videos, pictures and notes in Whatsapp Groups Lastly, your videos, notes and photos etc., should be shared among team members via Whatsapp groups. I think this is probably the easiest way. Also, you can use the bar code on your Whatsapp application to connect/sync with your PC directly to make transferring files from your phone to PC easy. Alright folks, have a great time down at Barcelona. ENJOY! "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
